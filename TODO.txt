PLAYGROUND:
- App Cards: hover behaviour; enlarge on hover, reveal description text
 (item grows, other list items shrink/move)

 WORD BASH:
 - SFX
 - Tooltips - wrong word entry, dupe answer attempt etc
 - Scoring to take extra vowels/consonants into account
 - Preset game sizes
 - Re-apply anim delay when winning, so additional letters move off in time with originals
 - Review css anims and class names, all the vars necessary for them (can i replace vars with 1-off anims?)
